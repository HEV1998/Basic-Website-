        <h1> Brief history  of the ragdoll</h1>
        <section id="intro">
        <p>The (<em>Ragdoll</em>) cat is a relatively modern breed with an interesting origin story rooted in California during the 1960s. The breed was developed by a woman named Ann Baker, who sought to create a cat with a distinctive appearance and a notably gentle temperament.
            Ann Baker, a Persian cat breeder from Riverside, California, started the Ragdoll breeding program. The foundation of the Ragdoll breed began with a domestic longhaired white cat named Josephine, which belonged to Baker's neighbor. Josephine was believed to have had a mix of Persian and Angora in her lineage.
            After a car accident, Josephine exhibited unusual traits such as an exceptionally docile temperament and a tendency to go limp when held. Baker believed these characteristics were passed down to Josephines kittens.</p>

        <h2> Characteristics</h2>
        <section id = "main">
            <p> Ragdolls are large, muscular cats with semi-long fur that is soft and silky. They typically have striking blue eyes and a color-pointed coat, which means their extremities (ears, face, paws, and tail) are darker than the rest of their bodies.
                Ragdolls are known for their calm, placid demeanor and affectionate nature. They are often described as “puppy-like” because they tend to follow their owners around and enjoy being handled and cuddled.
                Ragdolls generally have a good lifespan, ranging from 12 to 17 years. They are prone to certain health issues such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), but regular veterinary care can help manage these risks.
